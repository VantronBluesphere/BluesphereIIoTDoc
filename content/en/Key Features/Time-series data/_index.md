## Overview

A **time series** is a series of [data points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_point) indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. We provides a rich set of features related to time-series data. Assume you have already pushed time-series data to platform, you can:

- **Visualize** time series data using configurable and highly customizable widgets and [dashboards](https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/dashboards/);
- **Filter and analyze** data using flexible [Rule Engine](https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/re-getting-started/);
- **Generate [alarms](https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/alarms/)** based on collected data;
- **Forward** data to external systems using [External Rule Nodes](https://thingsboard.io/docs/pe/user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/external-nodes/) (e.g. Kafka or RabbitMQ Rule Nodes).
